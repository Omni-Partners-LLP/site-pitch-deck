# Roadmap

- Development plans reviewed periodically
- Updated development plan provided every 1-2 weeks, usually with release
- Originations is more mature and somewhat de-prioritised currently
- Finance reporting and primary loan servicing workflows are the priority
- Some features may jump up the queue if the requirement arises (e.g. fund allocations)
- Document generation will be expanded to cover more letters
- CRM integration (Zoho) os also being worked on

---

### Document Generation

- Standardising on Docxpresso - output is editable in Word
- Plan to integrate tracking generated and external documents more closely
- The most complex documents are either converted (Case Summary) or in progress (Facility Letter)
- Many templates require minimal values to be added so should be quick to integrate
- Aim is to have most documents require no manual intervention to be ready for use

---

### Zoho Integration

- Supports Jaxon and other originators in handling their leads and broker contacts
- Needs to ensure Zoho and main site remain in sync
- Will separate contact reords from cases to allow identifying related cases for an applicant
- Initial integration will simplify linking from Zoho to main site and syncing status
- If there is a discrepancy our site will be regarded as the primary source of truth
